# Python-E-Mail-Spoofer
Replace the necessary fields such as "spoofedemail@gmail.com", "recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com", "This is a spoofed email", "Hello", "this email was sent from a fake address!", "yourlogin@gmail.com", "yourpassword", and "smtp.gmail.com:587" with the desired values.

Keep in mind that email spoofing is a highly unethical and illegal practice that can result in severe consequences. I highly advise against using this code for malicious purposes.

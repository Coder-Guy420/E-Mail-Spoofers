Email-Spoofer
-------------

With this one, its probably more reliable than the other one, but you have to do more work because you have to replace the following variables.

"spoofedemail@gmail.com" with the email you want to spoof

"recipient1@example.com",(more recipients if wanted seperated by commas) with the recipients you want

"This is a spoofed email" with the subject

"Hello", "this email was sent from a fake address!" with the message

"yourlogin@gmail.com" with your email

"yourpassword" with the password to the email you entered

"smtp.gmail.com:587" with the smtp server.


Easy-Email-Spoofer
------------------

This one is in the name because it's easier to spoof email with it as it takes in user input.

V2
--

v2 has a new function which checks if the email entered is a valid email, and if it isnt a real email than it asks for the email again. Easy-Email-Spoofer is probably more reliable I just put this in here as a test
